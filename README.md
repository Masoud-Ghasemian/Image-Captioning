# Image-Captioning
â€¢	The goal of image captioning is to convert a given input image into a natural language description. The encoder-decoder framework is widely used for this task. The image encoder is a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this tutorial, we used InceptionV3 model to vectorize the Flicker30k dataset. The decoder is a long short-term memory (LSTM) network.Also, we used pre-trained GloVe word embeddings for the embedding layer.
